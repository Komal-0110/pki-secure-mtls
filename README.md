# go-pki-secure-mtls 🔐

A learning-focused yet production-structured project that implements a **Mini Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** in Go, including **X.509 certificate generation** and foundations for **TLS / Mutual TLS (mTLS)** authentication.

---

## 📌 Project Goal

To design and implement a working PKI system that:

- Generates a **Root Certificate Authority (CA)**
- Issues and manages **X.509 certificates**
- Enables secure communication using **TLS and mTLS**
- Demonstrates real-world **public key cryptography concepts**

---

## 🧠 What This Project Teaches

- How **public & private keys** work internally
- Structure and fields of **X.509 certificates**
- How **Root CAs** establish trust
- How services authenticate without passwords
- How Go uses `crypto/x509` and `crypto/tls`
